# Dynamic process of climbing
---
Task
---
A mountain tourist goes in one direction at a constant speed. 
He has a certain reserve of strength, which is consumed during movement. 
When the zero value is reached, it automatically stops to rest. During the rest, the reserve of strength can
be replenished again. The tourist's path consists of three parts: ascent, plain and descent. Each part
occupies a third of the total distance. When climbing, the forces are consumed faster and the maximum
speed is less than on the plain. On the descent , on the contrary , forces are spent more slowly and
the speed of movement is greater. The power consumption and speed on descent / ascent is proportional
to the slope of descent / ascent.
Set parameters: the speed of movement, the maximum reserve of forces, the length of the route,
the height of the mountain
Model controls: start moving, stop
Visualized values: strength reserve, distance traveled, current altitude, time
since the start of the simulation.
