# EventDriverProgModel

Task description
Develop a JAVA program using a graphical user
interface to control the simulation of a dynamic process.
Modeling parameters must be set before enabling process modeling.
After enabling the interface elements responsible for the simulation parameters, it is necessary
to lock (unlock again at the end).
Provide for the possibility of accelerating and slowing down the simulation time to
study slow- or fast-flowing processes.
In addition to using the standard graphical elements of the Swing library,
program the visualization of a dynamic process using custom
graphics.

My task: A mountain tourist goes in one direction at a constant speed. He has
a certain reserve of strength, which is consumed during movement. When the zero
value is reached, it automatically stops to rest. During the rest, the reserve of strength can
be replenished again. The tourist's path consists of three parts: ascent, plain and descent. Each part
occupies a third of the total distance. When climbing, the forces are consumed faster and the maximum
speed is less than on the plain. On the descent , on the contrary , forces are spent more slowly and
the speed of movement is greater. The power consumption and speed on descent / ascent is proportional
to the slope of descent / ascent.
Set parameters: the speed of movement, the maximum reserve of forces, the length of the route,
the height of the mountain
Model controls: start moving, stop
Visualized values: strength reserve, distance traveled, current altitude, time
since the start of the simulation.
